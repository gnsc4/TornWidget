## Development

If you wish to contribute or run the application from the source:

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Tauri CLI prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) for your specific OS.
* Tauri CLI:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
    # or
    yarn global add @tauri-apps/cli
    # or
    cargo install tauri-cli
    ```

### Running in Development Mode

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
2.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server and the Tauri app:
    ```bash
    npm run tauri dev
    ```
    This uses `vite` for the frontend and `tauri` for the application shell. The `beforeDevCommand` (`npm run dev`) will be executed automatically.

### Building for Production

1.  Install frontend dependencies (if not already done):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Build the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3.  Build the Tauri application:
    ```bash
    npm run tauri build
    ```
    This will generate the installers/bundles in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
